Title: SOM Networks for Comparing Patterns with Peak Shifts
Author: Ron Wehrens
Maintainer: Ron Wehrens <ron.wehrens@gmail.com>
Description: SOMs can be useful tools to group patterns containing several peaks. If peaks do not always occur at exactly the same position, classical distance measures cannot be used. This package provides SOM technology using the weighted crosscorrelation (WCC) distance.
